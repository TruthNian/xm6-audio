# Roadmap and acceptance

The repository contains a buildable native prototype. The initial hardware target is WH-1000XM6 on Windows 10 x64. Updated 2026-11-08.

## Implemented and covered by build / focused checks

- KMDF A2DP transport and per-device WaveRT render endpoint.
- Capability negotiation with LDAC/AAC/SBC in the default build.
- Integer16/24/32, float32, valid-bit metadata and encoder-boundary conversion.
- LDAC HQ frame-size/rate checks at 44.1, 48, 88.2 and 96 kHz.
- Buffered connection events, persistent overlapped signalling, service/device cleanup and stale-PCM discard.
- INF-owned, device-triggered codec service with Driver Store payload and signed-catalog deployment gate.
- Public CMake/MSVC/WDK CI, pinned dependencies, license bundle and source/hash manifest.

## Required before native deployment is accepted

1. **A legitimate Microsoft-signed package.** The [free-signing inquiry](https://github.com/SignPath/fdn-website/issues/28) is open; no approval exists. Normal boot protection is retained.
2. **Real audio and controls.** Verify the XM6 endpoint, audible music/video, system volume/mute and headset play/pause/previous/next. Packet counters do not satisfy this requirement.
3. **Format correctness.** Verify shared/exclusive streams, 32-bit integer/float and 24-in-32, supported sample-rate transitions and actual negotiated codec. The fixed LDAC 48 kHz/24-bit/HQ profile must produce its requested output or report failure.
4. **Lifecycle.** Verify installation/recovery, device-triggered startup, headset off/on, disconnect/reconnect, service restart and sleep/resume without stale audio or silent-success status.
5. **Timing and driver behavior.** Check video presentation timing and run appropriate driver diagnostics on a controlled system.

## Future work, after the initial native path is validated

Improve measured latency and queue behavior, broaden tested headset/radio combinations, and evaluate additional Windows/architecture targets. LE Audio/LC3 requires a separate supported platform/transport path; an A2DP capability parser is not an LE Audio implementation.

The inherited [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) is a protocol requirement catalogue, not proof of current hardware compatibility. The status table in the README and this acceptance list describe the current fork.
